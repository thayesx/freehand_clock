# Freehand Clock

Freehand is an analog clock face showing the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, as well as the local temperature and weather condition. It features two monochromatic color schemes (for light and dark mode), a minimalist look and feel based around bold, curved lines, and a proprietary icon library and numeral typeface, 'Freehand Numeric'.

Freehand is currently optimized for display on handheld screen sizes.

Freehand was built for [Flutter Clock Competition](https://flutter.dev/clock). It is built inside the provided `ClockCustomizer` container widget, and uses the `ClockModel` API for data on local temperature and weather condition.
